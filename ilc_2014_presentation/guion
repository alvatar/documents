# 2. Gettings Started

  ## 2.1 Origin of the project
  ## 2.2 Additionally
  ## 2.2 Requirements
     * As opposed to a black-box model of compilation where the user obtains a library/executable without access to object files or generated code.
     * Universal backend. Shared objects, loadable objects, source code...
     * SRFIs, lots of community code
     * i.e. FFI generation, system-aware code generation

# 5. Building apps for Android / iOS

  ## 5.1 Porting a simple app: text-based app on Android
     * build and test
     * how it works? inspect sakefile
     * how it works? micro templates in jni-generator/src/Android.mk.sct
     * cond-expand for conditional compilation
     * test in text-based app
  ## 5.2 Developing from the ground up: SDL / OpenGL(ES) app on iOS
     * Introduction: application blocks (MAKE GRAPHIC)
     * The three elements:
     * sakefile.scm
     * config.scm
     * cond/expands in code
  ## 5.3 The development process (host)
     * Run the app host:run (see expansions and dependencies)
     * Compile the app host:compile (see expansions and dependencies)
  ## 5.4 The development process (mobile)
     * What means interactive development?
     * Emacs vs. terminal
     * Running and updating remotely
     * Updating vs. evaluation
     * Updating the world live!
  ## 5.5 Deploying as a monolithic app
  ## 5.6 Advanced 
     * Thread inspection
     * fusion iOS utilities (iOS device detection)
